# volunteermommy

## Scope

Create an application to automate the process of scheduling preschool parent volunteers.  The application will allow users to register as a volunteer with the ability to add additional adult family members (spouse, aunts, uncles, grandparents, childcare provider, etc).  Users will also be able to create a profile for a child or children enrolled in the preschool.  

## MVP

1. As a user, I want to be able to add and/or delete adult family members as a school volunteer.  

2. As a user, I want to be able to and and/or delete a child or children enrolled in the school. 

## Additonal Functionality

3. As a user, I want to create an account and register as a school volunteer.

4. As a user, I want to sign up as a volunteer for a school event. 

5. As a user, I want to view all upcoming events. 

6. As a user, I want to view all events I've signed up to be a volunteer.

7. As an admin, I want to view a list of all registered volunteers. 

8. As an admin, I want to view an event with a list of registered volunteers.
